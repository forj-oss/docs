Summary
-------
If you want to develop like the OpenStack |reg| [1]_ project, the "Redstone" :term:`blueprint` is what you are after.

Learn more on the processes that are used by the OpenStack project here:

* `How to contribute to OpenStack <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute>`_
* `OpenStack infrastructure team <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/InfraTeam>`_

.. only:: pdf

  .. image:: /img/redstone_flow.png

In its current version, the Redstone blueprint contains the following features:

* Puppet master automation, create new modules and promote them in the :term:`forj-config` project.
* Gerrit/git services for revision control and change management.
	* Login with Launchpad openid, use `www.launchpad.net <http://www.launchpad.net>`_ to setup your email account for authentication.
	* Create open commits that can be reviewed with the team and gated for change before they hit master.
	* Tag and release changes when they are ready for testing or production.
	* Mark commits as work in progress or abandon revert old changes.
	* Create new gerrit projects and acl’s managed from source in forj-config project.
* Jenkins/Zuul integration
	* Create zuul macros to automate common build task, or re-use pre-existing openstack macros included in the pre-configured forj-config project.
	* Create automatic Jenkins jobs so that your team no longer manages Jenkins setup on Jenkins master, all configuration is managed as source in forj-config git project.
	* Gate changes and execute automated test as soon as changes make it to gerrit/git.
	* Promote changes based on gerrit events for tagging or comments made during reviews.
	* Login with launchpad openid
	* Zuul status: see what changes are being automatically tested, the progress and the status from one interface
* Pastebin integration
	* Collaborate with team mates with code snippets and log pasting for troubleshooting defects.
* Defect tracking
	* Mark gerrit changes with defect id’s to link to your defect system with Launchpad or HP Agile Manager

Project Management
------------------

You can manage project using Maestro user interface, or by editing the "forj-config" GIT repository (through Gerrit). 

Adding a new project
********************

In the Redstone blueprint, projects are managed by code, exactly like the OpenStack infrastructure project. This code, which sits in the forj-config Gerrit repository describes a project and is used to provision the entire chain associated to a project (Gerrit, Jenkins, Zuul).

With Maestro User Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* Enter the maestro UI and sign-in if needed, so you become the administrator and can add projects. The first user who logs becomes administrator and can add other administrators. Only administrator can create projects.
	* Connect to Gerrit. The first user who logs in to Gerrit becomes administrator
	* As a Gerrit administrator, add yourself to the "forj-config" group. This allows you to review and approve changes in the forj-config project
	* Go to the projects tab then add projects icon, finally set the name for you project and wait ~15 minutes until the change is propagated to gerrit (this uses Puppet mechanisms)
	* Go to Gerrit and approve (+2) or reject (-2) the project creation change
	* Once Puppet has done its work (up to 30 minutes), the new project is fully created and configured in Gerrit, Jenkins and Zuul

.. note::
	You can force "Puppet Apply" and speed up the process through the Jenkins "puppet-apply-all-nodes" job, or directly in a terminal session on the Maestro / Puppet master system


Using "Redstone" mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have full control of project creation by checking out the forj-config project and modifying the files that you need.

.. note::
	In the "Redstone" blueprint, everything is threated as code. You must go through Gerrit mechanisms to edit project configuration. Otherwise, your changes will be dismissed the next time the puppet master runs.

* Check out the forj-config project
	Each forge has its own forj-config project. Make sure your ssh keys are added to the gerrit server. To approve a change, make sure your user account is a member of the forj-core group.

* Assigning someone to be a verifier for forj-config project
	When there is no jenkins/zuul functionality on the forj-config project, it's sometimes necessary to verify changes manually. This can be performed by updating the group membership for Continuous Integration Tools group in gerrit.

* add an acl file (to the acls/production directory below) by using cookiecutter.config as an example found in the below path (i.e. make a copy)::

	[forj-config.git] / modules / runtime_project / files / gerrit / acls / templates /  cookiecutter.config

* place cookiecutter.config in directory (projectname should match the name of the project): (note: change the 'cookiecutter-core' to whatever group name you would like to use in your project: example: my-new-proj1-core)::

	[forj-config.git] / modules / runtime_project / files / gerrit / acls / production / projectname.config

* to create project edit file::

	[forj-config.git] / modules / runtime_project / templates / gerrit / config / production / review.projects.yaml.erb

* push changes to your gerrit repo:

	.. sourcecode:: console

		$ git add <new-project-acl-file>
		$ git add review.projects.yaml.erb
		$ git commit -m "my new project"
		$ git push 

* To learn more on how to configure yaml, see `jeepb <http://ci.openstack.org/jeepyb.html>`_ docs.
* you can migrate public projects with the upstream option.
* Projects that are created in gerrit currently have no approach for deletion, but these can be removed from normal users view through acl changes. For more info, please refer to : `rename project <http://ci.openstack.org/gerrit.html#renaming-a-project>`_ or remove project


Adding a new jenkins job and configure Zuul for a given project in gerrit
*************************************************************************
Zuul configuration consist of 4 basic parts.

1. update **hieradata** to include any new templates that will be used for the job in **runtime_project/files/hiera/hieradata/Debian/nodetype/ci.yaml**

	* this is only needed if you need a new compiler option, or new tool that will not exist on the build server.

	* configure in the following section ci-node -> class cdk_project::jenkins -> job_builder_configs. 

	Example:

		.. sourcecode:: yaml

			cdk_project::jenkins::job_builder_configs:
				- 'tutorials.yaml'
				- '<new_job_template_name>.yaml'

2. configure the new template into **runtime_project/templates/jenkins_job_builder/config/**

	* a pre-existing template file can be used to describe the builders for the job, or a new one can be created

	* pre-existing macros can be found in runtime_project/files/jenkins_job_builder/config/macros.yaml

3. update layout.yaml in **runtime_project/files/zuul/config/production/layout.yaml**

	* the projects section should be updated with the new project and gates, along with jobs that will be executed from projects.yaml, example:

	.. sourcecode:: yaml

		projects:
		 - name: tutorials
		   check:
		     - tutorials-flake8
		   gate:
		     - tutorials-flake8
		   post:
		     - puppet-apply-all-nodes
		   release:
		     - tutorials-flake8


4. add the project section to **runtime_project/files/jenkins_job_builder/config/projects.yaml**

	* this will define the jobs to be created in jenkins, job names will be mapped to buiders by zuul. The "name" must match the job-template layout file (line 2 in the jenkins_job_builder file), and the "git_project" must match with the name of your project in gerrit.

	.. sourcecode:: yaml

		projects:
		   name: tutorials
		   git_project: tutorials
		   branch: master
		   jobs:
		    - '{name}-flake8'
		    - '{name}-<new_job_name>'

Once this is done, you will need to push the changes to gerrit, verify and submit. Next the eroplus box will need to run puppet cycle, or puppet agent -t to get the new runtime_project udpates. Finally the ci server will need to run a puppet cycle or puppet agent -t so that the job builder can setup the job.

.. Note:: More info on zuul: `http://ci.openstack.org/zuul <http://ci.openstack.org/zuul>`_


Remove a project in gerrit
**************************

* Stop gerrit:

	.. sourcecode:: console

		$ sudo service gerrit stop

* start the gsql client on local admin bash shell:

	.. sourcecode:: console

		$ java -jar /home/gerrit2/review_site/bin/gerrit.war gsql -d /home/gerrit2/review_site

* remove entries from table account_project_watches

	.. sourcecode:: sql

		select * from account_project_watches;
		delete from account_project_watches where project_name = 'tutorials-2'
		delete changes
		select * from changes where dest_project_name = 'tutorials-2';
		delete from changes where dest_project_name = 'tutorials-2';

* Remove the repo from disk.

	.. sourcecode:: console

		$ rm -rf /var/lib/git/tutorials-2.git
		$ rm -rf /home/gerrit2/review_site/git/tutorials-2.git/

.. Note:: this should be done on all replicas

* Start gerrit back up

	.. sourcecode:: console

		$ service gerrit start


User management
---------------

In the Redstone blueprint, the first user who authenticates to Gerrit and Jenkins become administrator. Then, it is the role of the administrator to add users in the respective tools and projects.

Configure Email Notifications
-----------------------------

In order to gerrit send email notifications you need to configure it first.

* First you need to have at least one project configured in gerrit, and have a forj-config clone git repository.
* Have a external MTA account, in this example we will use sendgrid_. This service has a free account option if you want to try it.
* In the path **forj-config/modules/runtime_project/files/hiera/layouts/** you need to make the following changes in the file **maestro.yaml**:

.. _sendgrid: http://sendgrid.com/

    .. sourcecode:: yaml

          classes:
            - ....
            - exim_config

          exim_config::smarthost: 'smtp.sendgrid.net'
          exim_config::port: '587 byname'
          exim_config::smtp_require_auth: true
          exim_config::smtp_username: 'YOUR_USER'
          exim_config::smtp_password: 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
          exim_config::queue_smtp_domains: 'localhost.org'
          exim_config::relay_from_hosts:
            - '127.0.0.1'
            - "%{::exim_config::utils::review_ip}"

          sysadmin_config::manage_servers::iptables_public_tcp_ports:
            - 25
            - ...

* In the same path as above, modify the file **review.yaml** adding the following lines:

    .. sourcecode:: yaml

        classes:
          - exim_config::utils
          - ...

        gerrit_config::smtpserver:      "%{::exim_config::utils::maestro_ip}"
        gerrit_config::sendemail_from:  'YOUR_SENDFROM_EMAIL_NAME'

Email Troubleshooting
---------------------

If you are having problems with this configuration, you can try these steps to find where the problem is.

1. Check if gerrit was configured correctly in Review server:
    1. Check gerrit's config file located in **/home/gerrit2/review_site/etc/gerrit.config** you should have something similar:

    .. sourcecode:: yaml

            [sendemail]
            smtpServer = 10.0.0.90
            from = robot <robot@my.com>

    2. A common problem is an empty IP address, just make sure that **exim_config::utils** in classes is located **before** gerrit class.
    3. Check if the port 25 is open on maestro server:

    .. sourcecode:: console

            $ nc -v 10.0.0.90 smtp
            Connection to 10.0.0.90 25 port [tcp/smtp] succeeded!
            220 maestro.v5.dev.forj.io ESMTP Exim 4.76 Fri, 18 Jul 2014 22:00:05 +0000

    4. Make sure that you have at least 2 users registered in gerrit before attempting to test it.
    5. While you generate the email event in gerrit, keep monitoring log file: **tail -f /home/gerrit2/review_site/logs/error_log**, you should see if the mail was attempted to sent.

2. Check if exim was correctly configured in maestro.
    1. Try to send a test email to check if the external smtp server was configured correctly:

     .. sourcecode:: console

        $ echo "Test email " | mail -s "test external" <email_address@my.com>

    2. If you didn't receive the mail you can test changing the parameters manually in exim config file

     .. sourcecode:: console

        $ service exim4 stop
        $ vim /etc/exim4/exim4.conf
        $ service exim4 start

    3. As a alternative you can use a terminal email client to make further tests.

     .. sourcecode:: console

        $ apt-get install mutt
        $ vim ~/.muttrc

     and add the following line:

     .. sourcecode:: console

        set smtp_url = "smtp://smtp.sendgrid.net:587"

     try to send a test email

     .. sourcecode:: console

       echo "Test email " | mutt -s "test external" email_address@my.com

    4. You can view exim logs in the following location: **/var/log/exim4/mainlog**

* Allow puppet to run at least twice on both maestro and review nodes in order to see your changes show up.

Configure DNS Names
-------------------
Initially when you deploy your forge, you will refrence your forge by ip address
but this is not practical for your end-users.  It's possible to assign a well
known dns name to your forge nodes from a DNS server outside of your cloud
account.  This section will only describe the areas of [forj-config] that can
be updated to controll the naming behavior for jenkins and gerrit.  We will not
attempt to describe how to use external DNS service.

1. The following files will be modified to give a well known domain name for each node.
   You should register the domains with your DNS provider.

   **[forj-config]/modules/runtime_project/**

   =====================   ==================================   ====================
   Directory               file                                 Proposed DNS names
   =====================   ==================================   ====================
   ./files/hiera/layouts   maestro.yaml                         maestro.yourdomain.com
   ./files/hiera/layouts   ci.yaml                              ci.yourdomain.com
   ./files/hiera/layouts   review.yaml                          review.yourdomain.com
   ./files/hiera/layouts   util.yaml                            util.yourdomain.com

7. Commit and approve these changes.

Install SSL Certificates
------------------------

The Redstone blueprint will install a custom certificate that is digitally
signed by a self signed certificate registry located on maestro.  This is
managed by the cacerts puppet module from the `forj-oss/maestro <https://github.com/forj-oss/maestro>`_ repository.
This however means that developers and end-users that access the **review** and **ci**
nodes for your forge will be warned and prompted to continue navigation to the
site because these certificates are not typically trusted by the browser.

.. image:: /img/https_error.png

In this section we will describe the process you can follow for configuring a
digitally signed certificate from a certificate authority that would more
commonly be trusted by your browser.  This would replace the automated self
signed certificates that are auto generated by maestro.  When making changes to 
the [forj-config] repository, be aware that the same ci workflow used for updating
projects and gates still applies here.

1. Generate a private key and certificate signing request(csr).
   This can be performed with 
   `these instructions <https://knowledge.verisign.com/support/ssl-certificates-support/index?page=content&actp=CROSSLINK&id=AR198>`_ 
   documented on the verisign website.

   Example:

   .. sourcecode:: console
   
      $ openssl genrsa -passout pass:secretpass -des3 -out review.yourdomain.com.key 2048
      $ openssl req -new -key review.yourdomain.com.key -out review.yourdomain.com.csr    

-  Submit the .csr request to your certificate authority (verisign for example) 
   and save away your private keys.  If you also recieve intermediate
   certificates, such as a corporate signing authority, you will need to save
   those as well.  These will be your intermediate certificate chain.
-  Ideally this request is performed for **review** and **ci** nodes.  Long term, you will also want one for the maestro node.
   At this time, we do not need a certificate for the **maestro** node.
  
2. Create a custom_certs module to deliver your certs.

   clone the [forj-config] project from your Redstone forge so that we can create a new module to store and deploy
   the certificates.  Even though the private key is protected, it's possible to store the credentials for the 
   certificate in a secure hiera eyaml file on maestro for decription.  In these steps we are only creating
   the certificates for **review** node, but you can repeat this for **ci** and **maestro** nodes.

   Folder layout for custom_certs puppet module:

   **[forj-config]/modules/custom_certs/**

   ====================   ==================================   ====================
   Directory              file                                 Description
   ====================   ==================================   ====================
   ./files/certs          chain.crt                            This is your certificate signer public certs.
   ./files/certs          review.yourdomain.com.locked_key     This is the private key generated in step 1.  Password included.
   ./files/certs          review.yourdomain.com.csr            Your certificate request
   ./files/certs          review.yourdomain.com.cst            Your x509 signed cert from your certificate provider.
   ./files/manifests      review_sslparams.pp                  This will contain puppet ref vars to ssl cert contents.
   ====================   ==================================   ====================
   

3. Create a class file **<node>**\_sslparams.pp for each cert that will be needed.
   In this case we create the class file for the **review** node (review_sslparams.pp).  
   We can't use the normal puppet file function because it will fail on runs where the cert doesn't exist, but
   we can use a custom parser function provided by [forj-oss/maestro]::cacerts called cacerts_getkey.
   
   Sample Code to create in forj-config:
   
   [forj-config] / modules / custom_certs / manifest / review_sslparams.pp
   
   .. sourcecode:: puppet
       
        class custom_certs::review_sslparams
        (
          $ca_certs_db  = hiera('cacerts::ca_certs_db','/opt/config/cacerts'),
        )
        {
          $ssl_cert_file_contents      = cacerts_getkey( "${ca_certs_db}/custom/review.yourdomain.com.crt" )
          $ssl_key_file_contents       = cacerts_getkey( "${ca_certs_db}/custom/review.yourdomain.com.key" )
          $ssl_chain_file_contents     = cacerts_getkey( "${ca_certs_db}/custom/chain.crt" )
          if $ssl_cert_file_contents != ''
          {
            notify{'custom cert found for ci ssl_cert_file_contents':
              before => Class['cdk_project::gerrit'],  # here we call the class we want to run before.
            }
          } else
          {
            warning('ci ssl_cert_file_contents is empty for custom cert')
          }
        }

  - The default location for certs will be in /opt/config/cacerts for maestro node.  
    Under this folder we will place the custom certs in a custom folder.  
    The notify resource will be used to sequence the cert configuration of the
    parameters prior to any actions on the classes from gerrit.
  - Note, the chain.crt is simply the collection of pem files for the certificate
    signers public keys that are created for the trust authority.  You can make
    this empty if you are using a well known provider that comes installed with
    the browsers you want to support.
  - repeat the steps for the ci node, by changing all the **review** names to **ci**.
  - Note, for the ci node, change :
      **before => Class['cdk_project::gerrit'],**
    to 
      **before => Class['cdk_project::jenkins'],**

4. Un-comment or add this sections to maestro.yaml in [forj-config]::runtime_project
   This will place all the files from your custom_certs module into
   **/opt/config/cacerts/custom** on the **maestro** node.

   Sample Code to create in forj-config:
   
   [forj-config] / modules / runtime_project / files / hiera / layouts / maestro.yaml
   
   .. sourcecode:: yaml
   
      classes:
        - runtime_project::install
        - sysadmin_config::manage_servers
        - cacerts::custom                  # user story #2189: uncomment this to enable custom cert installation
      
      # ...
      # 2. uncomment the source module that will hold all custom certs to be unpackaged.
      cacerts::custom::source: 'puppet:///modules/custom_certs/certs'
      # ...

5. Setup the master password for certs that were created in step 1 on the maestro box.
   The password itself will be encrypted on maestro under **/etc/puppet/hieradata/common.eyaml**
   with public/private keys found in **/etc/puppet/secure**
   Make sure **thepassword** matches the password you selected in step 1 for **secretpass**.

   **ssh to maestro node**:
   
   .. sourcecode:: console
   
      $ sudo -i
      $ cd /etc/puppet/secure
      $ eyaml encrypt -l 'cacerts::custom::ca_pass' -s 'thepassword' | grep "cacerts::custom::ca_pass: ENC" >> /etc/puppet/hieradata/common.eyaml

6. Add the following yaml to **[forj-config]::runtime_project / files / hiera / layouts / <node>.yaml** files.
   If you are setting up custom certs for **review** and **ci** nodes, then you will update the follwing two files:

   =============================================   ===============
   Directory                                       file           
   =============================================   ===============
   /modules/runtime_project/files/hiera/layouts    review.yaml
   /modules/runtime_project/files/hiera/layouts    ci.yaml
   =============================================   ===============


   - Add another class to classes: array.
   - Set the ssl_*_contents sections to the class param values.
   
   review.yaml contents:

   .. sourcecode:: yaml

      classes:
        - custom_certs::review_sslparams
      
      # ...
      
      # these will be automatically created if we pass them in empty.
      cdk_project::gerrit::ssl_cert_file_contents:           "%{::custom_certs::review_sslparams::ssl_cert_file_contents}"
      cdk_project::gerrit::ssl_key_file_contents:            "%{::custom_certs::review_sslparams::ssl_key_file_contents}"
      cdk_project::gerrit::ssl_chain_file_contents:          "%{::custom_certs::review_sslparams::ssl_chain_file_contents}"
      
      # ...

   ci.yaml contents:

   .. sourcecode:: yaml

      classes:
        - custom_certs::ci_sslparams
      
      # ...
      
      # these will be automatically created if we pass them in empty.
      cdk_project::jenkins::ssl_cert_file_contents:   "%{::custom_certs::ci_sslparams::ssl_cert_file_contents}"
      cdk_project::jenkins::ssl_key_file_contents:    "%{::custom_certs::ci_sslparams::ssl_key_file_contents}"
      cdk_project::jenkins::ssl_chain_file_contents:  "%{::custom_certs::ci_sslparams::ssl_chain_file_contents}"
      
      # ...

7. Execute puppet apply commands as root on **maestro**, **ci**, and **review** nodes in that order.
   Connect to the maestro node and run these commands:

   .. sourcecode:: console
   
      $ sudo -i
      $ puppet agent -t
      $ salt -E '(ci|review).*' cmd.run "/usr/bin/puppet agent -t"
 
8. If certs don't imediately install, you can also restart apache services on each node:

   .. sourcecode:: console
   
      $ salt -E '(ci|review).*' cmd.run "service apache2 restart"


.. _redstone-blueprint-faq:

FAQ
---
... How do I create a new project?

   Creating a new project on a redstone forge means creating a new Gerrit repository.
   We use the CI workflow of the forge itself to manage the project creation process.
   Configuration files are modified and updated to provide the administrator of 
   the forge an oportunity to review the commit. Currently we do not provide 
   automatic review option, but one could be setup using zuul gate triggers.

... re-trigger the verification for project create change request?

   If your forge did not trigger a verification check for the project creation 
   request, it is possible to re-trigger the request on the change request.
   Go to the change request and add a new comment.  Make the comment text say:
   'recheck no bug'. This should trigger a zuul gate check for the change request.

... approve a new project creation request on gerrit?

    First you must be the administrator of your forge or contact and the administrator
    of the forge you will try to access.  The approving user must be added to the 
    group, forj-core.  This can be done in Gerrit from the Admin->Groups menu by the 
    Gerrit administrator.  Once done, the user added can then administer
    approvals by adding +2 for Code Review and +1 for Approved on the change request.

... change the group that approves changes for forj-config on gerrit?

    Approval permissions for groups is managed by the forj-config acl's file.
    This can be updated with a change request update to the forj-config source on the
    file : 
    [forj-config.git]/modules/runtime_project/files/gerrit/acls/production/forj-config.config
    
    Change the group forj-core to a new group name.  If the group does not exist
    a new one will be created.
